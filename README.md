# Plant_Disease_Prediction_Model

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant leaf images into different disease categories. The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset and aims to help farmers and agricultural professionals identify plant diseases based on visual symptoms.


## Run Locally
